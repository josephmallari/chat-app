## Details
I used the create-react-app builder for this project along with the `--template typescript` flag.
I broke down the code into three components. The App component, Message component, and Reply component. 
For the purpose of this task, I think that 3 was sufficient. 

For the CSS, I just simply edited the default App.css file. I think that the project was simple enough that using sass was unnecessary or
any other library like styled components or CSS-in-JS. For a more project oriented build, I would have used one of these said libraries.

Parts of the code are commented for more explanation.

I hope you like it and thanks for looking!
